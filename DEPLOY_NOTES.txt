Deploy-ready package (automatic edits):
- Rewrote backend/server.py to be a complete, deployable FastAPI app with health and CRUD endpoints.
- Added backend/Dockerfile and backend/Procfile for container and PaaS deployment.
- Added backend/.env.example to show runtime env variables.
- If you have a MONGO_URI set in backend/.env or environment, the app will connect to MongoDB. Otherwise an in-memory store is used.
- To run locally:
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    uvicorn server:app --reload
- To build Docker:
    docker build -t my-backend:latest .
    docker run -p 8000:8000 my-backend:latest

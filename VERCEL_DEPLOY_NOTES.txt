Vercel deployment notes
-----------------------
This project is prepared for Vercel:

- vercel.json routes requests to backend/server.py and uses the Python runtime.
- requirements.txt at repository root lists Python runtime dependencies for Vercel to install.
- The FastAPI app in backend/server.py exposes the ASGI `app` variable (required).
- If you use a MongoDB connection, set the MONGO_URI environment variable in your Vercel Project Settings.
- To deploy:
    1. Push this repo to GitHub (or connect your repo to Vercel).
    2. In Vercel, import the repo and deploy. Vercel will detect the Python runtime and run your FastAPI app.
